# :warning: NOTICE :warning:

This app is no longer being maintained. It does still compile (with warnings) and run showing some information about the computer. If you still really want to use this, feel free. Below I'll include my original readme notes.


# hostinfoapp
 
hostinfoapp provides quick and convient access to important system information of the computer it is currently running on.

## Building/Compiling/Running

### Prereqs and Editor
You will need to have NodeJS installed on your machine. I also recommend using Visual Studio Code as an IDE.

### Setup
Before you can run the app with NodeJS, you will need to install dependencies first. Run the following:
```
npm install
```

### Running the App

Once everything is setup, simply use this command to start the app:
```
npm start
```

## Note about Yarn
This project is currently using the standard node packages model to build dependencies. At the moment the app will not compile with yarn, but I am trying to port this over. Please let me know if you have any success with this.
